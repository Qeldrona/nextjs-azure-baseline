# nextjs-azure-baseline

This is a bare bones application to run nextJS on Azure App Service. You can run this app on an Azure App Service (Linux/Node) without any additional setup - Just deploy to your app service (Kudu build engine).

It is important to leave the server.js file at the root of the project and to keep your build/start scripts the same unless you know what you're doing. 

Run Locally:
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
